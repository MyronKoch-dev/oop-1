## Path Determination Algorithm

1. Calculate scores for all possible paths based on user responses
2. For the Contractor path, apply a hard requirement check (must have both Rust and TypeScript languages and Cosmos SDK chains experience)
3. Sort paths by descending score
4. Return the highest scoring path as the primary recommendation
5. Return the second-highest scoring path as the secondary recommendation
